                <p>I am a Front-end software engineer with a background in digital marketing, graphic & 3D design based in Tokyo, JP.</p>
                <p>My path to software engineering began while working closely with software engineer at my first company, where I learned and became interested in Front-end engineer and eventually decide to pursue programming full-time.</p>
                <p>Since then, I have built numerous full-stack webapps and website on Node/Express, leveraging Javascript framework such as React. I have been working more on the front-end side of applications as this is the field I am particularly excited about.</p>
